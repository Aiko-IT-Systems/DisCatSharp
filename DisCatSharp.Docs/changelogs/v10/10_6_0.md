# Upgrade from **10.4.0** to **10.6.0**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We dropped support for .NET 5 in favor of newer features and major improvements in speed and stability.
>
> We removed previously deprecated fields and methods.
>
> We fixed a major bug with the gateway connection: Previously it wasn't actually applying the `version`, `encoding`, and `compress` fields, causing the gateway to use the default but deprecated version 6.

> [!WARNING]
> This release contains important bug fixes and improvements.
> We recommend you to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> With this version, we are re-opening issues on GitHub. We hope that everything goes well and we can keep them open.
> You can continue to use our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RXA6u3jxdU) for support tho.

## Why weren't there any releases for a long time?

We've been focusing on rewriting internals and improving the library.
Most of the changes were considered highly experimental and not ready for public use.

Other reasons were the lack of motivation to write changelogs üòÖ

## Why does this changelog look so small?

We've been focusing on rewriting internals and improving the library.

Furthermore we might have added new features we haven't tracked on our changelog list, we're gonna add them when we find them again üòÖ

Every developer should at least have heard about [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

They were so kind to provide us with a free business plan üôèüíï

With the integration of Sentry, we're taking a significant leap forward in proactively managing library errors.

Sentry's real-time error tracking enables us to identify and rectify issues swiftly, often before they impact users.

This enhancement is not just about fixing bugs faster; it's about ensuring a seamless and stable experience for everyone using our library.

To enable this feature and help us to improve our library, you need to set up some things in the [DiscordConfiguration](xref:DisCatSharp.DiscordConfiguration):

```cs
DiscordConfiguration configuration = new()
{
    // other settings
    EnableSentry = true, // To generally enable sentry
    AttachUserInfo = true, // To attach the bot id and username to sentry reports
    DeveloperUserId = 32183902178903721, // Set your Discord id here so we can reach out to you if we have questions to a bug. Set null or leave it out to disable this feature.
    FeedbackEmail = "your@email.com", // Set your email here so we can reach out to you if we have questions to a bug.
    ReportMissingFields = true // To let sentry report missing fields in API payloads
};
```

### Update check on startup

We've added a new feature to check for new library versions on startup.

This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled in the [DiscordConfiguration](xref:DisCatSharp.DiscordConfiguration).

You can configure the update check with the following properties:

```cs
DiscordConfiguration configuration = new()
{
    // other settings
    DisableUpdateCheck = true, // To disable the update check on startup
    ShowReleaseNotesInUpdateCheck = false, // To disable the release notes in the update check on startup
    UpdateCheckMode = UpdateCheckMode.GitHub, // To check against GitHub instead of NuGet
    UpdateCheckGitHubToken = "ghp_your_token" // Set this to use a personal access token, in case you're getting rate limited or you have access to private extensions
};
```

Every official extension supports this too. You currently can't disable this feature seperatly for extensions.

## Future Roadmap

<br/>

### DisCatSharp.Voice (Planned)

We're working on **DisCatSharp.Voice** which is set to replace the existing **DisCatSharp.VoiceNext**. It's planned to have better performance, stability and maintainability than its predecessor.
Particularly, this will bring back the receiving of incoming audio. Please note that any details are subject to change as development progresses.

### Caching System Overhaul (Under Consideration)

A major overhaul of our caching system is planned. The goal of this proposed rewrite is to increase reliability, performance and to add flexibility in how data is stored and retrieved.
We are still in the cenceptual stage for this.

### Audit Log Functionality Enhancement (In Development)

We want to revamp how we implement the Discord audit log API. This will enhance the functionality and ease-of-use.
The enhancements we are planning are still in the developmental phase and might change.

### DisCatSharp.CommandNext Revamp (Proposed)

A complete rewrite of **DisCatSharp.CommandsNext** is proposed. We want to rewrite this for improved maintainability and for potential performance and usability improvements.

### Cooldowns for DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands (Planned)

We are planning to add support for cooldowns in DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands. This feature would allow developers to set cooldowns for commands, preventing users from spamming commands. While this feature is still in the planning phase, we will provide updates as development progresses.
