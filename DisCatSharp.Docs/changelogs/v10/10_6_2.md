## Completed Roadmap

<br/>

### Cooldowns for DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands (Completed)

We were planning to add support for cooldowns in DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands. This feature would allow developers to set cooldowns for commands, preventing users from spamming commands. This is now implemented. See [this article](xref:modules_application_commands_cooldowns) for details.

## Future Roadmap

<br/>

### Signed Attachment

We added signed attachments previously but it clashed with other attachment types and broke. We will re-introduce the entity at some point soon.

### DisCatSharp.Voice (Planned)

We're working on **DisCatSharp.Voice** which is set to replace the existing **DisCatSharp.VoiceNext**. It's planned to have better performance, stability and maintainability than its predecessor.
Particularly, this will bring back the receiving of incoming audio. Please note that any details are subject to change as development progresses.

### Audit Log Functionality Enhancement (On Hold)

We want to revamp how we implement the Discord audit log API. This will enhance the functionality and ease-of-use.
The enhancements we are planning are still in the developmental phase and might change.

### Caching System Overhaul (Planned)
A complete rewrite of **DisCatSharp.CommandsNext** is proposed. We want to rewrite this for improved maintainability and for potential performance and usability improvements.

### DisCatSharp.CommandNext Revamp (Proposed)

complete rewrite of **DisCatSharp.CommandsNext** is proposed. We want to rewrite this for improved maintainability and for potential performance and usability improvements.
