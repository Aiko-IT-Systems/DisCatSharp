## Other important info

<br/>

After we've received concerns about the privacy for our users when using Sentry, by Quinch, we've investigated possible issues together with the team at Discord.

While we did not find any privacy leaks, we did implemented additional client-side filters to further enhance user safety & privacy.

For that we've added a new [article](xref:misc_sentry) about our Sentry integration.

You can read the full report here: [Sentry Safety Report](xref:sec_comp_sentry).

<br/>

Additionally we've made updates to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and our [Security Policy](https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

We added the following new terms:

**Unacceptable Behavior:** Rude, offensive, or disrespectful behavior, including AI-generated content that does not adhere to our guidelines, will not be tolerated.
**Enforcement:** Violations of our guidelines may result in bans or other appropriate measures.

## Future Roadmap

<br/>

### Signed Attachment

We added signed attachments previously but it clashed with other attachment types and broke. We will re-introduce the entity at some point soon.

### DisCatSharp.Voice (Planned)

We're working on DisCatSharp.Voice which is set to replace the existing DisCatSharp.VoiceNext. It's planned to have better performance, stability and maintainability than its predecessor. Particularly, this will bring back the receiving of incoming audio. Please note that any details are subject to change as development progresses.

### Audit Log Functionality Enhancement (On Hold)

We want to revamp how we implement the Discord audit log API. This will enhance the functionality and ease-of-use. The enhancements we are planning are still in the developmental phase and might change.

### Caching System Overhaul (Planned)

A major overhaul of our caching system is planned. The goal of this proposed rewrite is to increase reliability, performance and to add flexibility in how data is stored and retrieved. We are still in the cenceptual stage for this.

### DisCatSharp.CommandNext Revamp (Proposed)

A complete rewrite of DisCatSharp.CommandsNext is proposed. We want to rewrite this for improved maintainability and for potential performance and usability improvements.
