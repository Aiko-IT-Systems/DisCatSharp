# DisCatSharp Analyzer Rule DCS0201

This needs a special override, otherwise it will not work.

We provide a override value, which is known to work.

But you can use newer ones, if you want to.

We provide a codefix for this, which tries to set the best possible `Override` value to your [DiscordConfiguration](xref:DisCatSharp.DiscordConfiguration).
