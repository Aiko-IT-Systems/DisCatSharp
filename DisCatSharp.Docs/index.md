## DisCatSharp 10.0.0 Documentation
[DisCatSharp](https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/DisCatSharp) (DCS) is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro "Discord API") based off [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus).<br/>
The library has been rewritten to fit quality and API standards as well as target wider range of .NET implementations. Furthermore this lib will includes many new features of Discord and is pretty fast with keeping up with Discords API.

## Getting Started
New users probably want to take a look into the [articles](xref:preamble) for quick start guides, tutorials, and examples of use.<br/>
Once you've gotten through the articles, head over to the [API Documentation](/api/index.html) for all classes and methods provided by this library.
