# API Reference

Welcome to the DisCatSharp.Experimental API reference.

To begin, select a namespace, then a class, from the table of contents on the left.

# Note

This package delivers experimental features that are not meant for end-users.

We might change them at any time without prior notice.

Please install the DisCatSharp.Analyzer.Roslyn package to properly use these features.
