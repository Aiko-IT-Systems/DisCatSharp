# Introduction to Application Commands
Discord provides built-in commands called: *Application Commands*.<br/>
Be sure to install the `DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands` package from NuGet before continuing.

At the moment it is possible to create such commands:
- Slash commands
- User context menu commands
- Message context menu commands

## Writing an Application Commands

### Creation of the first commands

Each command is a method with the attribute [SlashCommand](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.Attributes.SlashCommandAttribute) or [ContextMenu](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.Attributes.ContextMenuAttribute). They must be in classes that inherit from [ApplicationCommandsModule](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.ApplicationCommandsModule).
Also, the first argument to the method must be [InteractionContext](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.Context.InteractionContext) or [ContextMenuContext](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.Context.ContextMenuContext).

Simple slash command:
```cs
public class MyCommand : ApplicationCommandsModule
{
    [SlashCommand("my_command", "This is description of the command.")]
    public async Task MySlashCommand(InteractionContext ctx)
    {

    }
}
```

Simple context menu command:
```cs
public class MySecondCommand : ApplicationCommandsModule
{
    [ContextMenu(ApplicationCommandType.User, "My Command")]
    public async Task MyContextMenuCommand(ContextMenuContext ctx)
    {

    }
}
```

Now let's add some actions to the commands, for example, send a reply:
```cs
await ctx.CreateResponseAsync(InteractionResponseType.ChannelMessageWithSource, new DiscordInteractionResponseBuilder()
{
    Content = "Hello :3"
});
```

If the command will be executed for more than 3 seconds, we must response at the beginning of execution and edit it at the end.
```cs
await ctx.CreateResponseAsync(InteractionResponseType.DeferredChannelMessageWithSource, new DiscordInteractionResponseBuilder());

await Task.Delay(5000); // Simulating a long command execution.

await ctx.EditResponseAsync(new DiscordWebhookBuilder()
{
    Content = "Hello :3"
});
```

>[!NOTE]
> Note that you can make your commands static, but then you cannot use [Dependency Injection](xref:modules_commandsnext_dependency_injection) in them.


### Registration of commands

After writing the commands, we must register them. For this we need a [DiscordClient](xref:DisCatSharp.DiscordClient).

```cs
var appCommands = client.UseApplicationCommands();

appCommands.RegisterGlobalCommands<MyCommand>();
appCommands.RegisterGlobalCommands<MySecondCommand>();
```
Simple, isn't it? You can register global and guild commands.
Global commands will be available on all guilds of which the bot is a member. Guild commands will only appear in a specific guild.

To register guild commands, it is enough to specify the Id of the guild as the first argument of the registration method.

```cs
var appCommands = client.UseApplicationCommands();

appCommands.RegisterGuildCommands<MyCommand>(<guildId>);
appCommands.RegisterGuildCommands<MySecondCommand>(<guildId>);
```

## Command Groups

Sometimes we may need to combine slash commands into groups.
In this case, we need to wrap our class with commands in another class and add the [SlashCommandGroup](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.Attributes.SlashCommandGroupAttribute) attribute.

```cs
public class MyCommand : ApplicationCommandsModule
{
    [SlashCommandGroup("my_command", "This is description of the command group.")]
    public class MyCommandGroup : ApplicationCommandsModule
    {
        [SlashCommand("first", "This is description of the command.")]
        public async Task MySlashCommand(InteractionContext ctx)
        {
            await ctx.CreateResponseAsync(InteractionResponseType.ChannelMessageWithSource, new DiscordInteractionResponseBuilder()
            {
                Content = "This is first subcommand."
            });
        }
        [SlashCommand("second", "This is description of the command.")]
        public async Task MySecondCommand(InteractionContext ctx)
        {
            await ctx.CreateResponseAsync(InteractionResponseType.ChannelMessageWithSource, new DiscordInteractionResponseBuilder()
            {
                Content = "This is second subcommand."
            });
        }
    }
}
```

Commands will now be available via `/my_command first` and `/my_command second`.
Also, note that both classes must inherit [ApplicationCommandsModule](xref:DisCatSharp.ApplicationCommands.ApplicationCommandsModule).
